# QA & Tooling Audit Report

This report summarizes the findings of a comprehensive end-to-end quality assurance and tooling audit performed on the project repository.

## 1. Executive Summary

The audit covered four main areas: Automated UI/game testing, Lighthouse performance scores, code quality, and general site integrity.

| Area | Status | Summary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Automated Tests** | ‚ùå **Blocked** | A full suite of Playwright tests was developed, but execution was blocked by persistent environment timeouts. The tests cannot be run to completion. |
| **Lighthouse** | ‚úÖ **Pass** | All audited pages meet or exceed the performance, accessibility, and best practices thresholds. Scores are excellent across the board. |
| **Code Quality** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Improvement** | Linters and formatters were set up. While many style issues were autofixed, significant underlying issues remain, primarily due to a lack of TypeScript typing and some HTML syntax errors. |
| **Site Integrity** | ‚úÖ **Pass** | A broken link scan of the entire site found no dead links. |

**Overall, the site is in good shape from a user-facing performance and accessibility perspective, but the developer experience and testability are severely hampered by tooling issues and code quality debt.**

## 2. Found Defects & Action Plan

This is a prioritized list of defects found during the audit, with proposed fixes.

### üî¥ P0: Critical Defects

1.  **Playwright Test Suite is Un-runnable**
    -   **Issue:** The entire Playwright test suite, even when run file-by-file, consistently times out in the test environment. This prevents any automated regression testing from being effective.
    -   **Analysis:** The root cause appears to be a fundamental performance bottleneck in the execution environment, making browser automation prohibitively slow. Neither `wrangler` nor `http-server` (when managed by Playwright or run as a background process) could resolve this.
    -   **Recommendation:**
        -   **Immediate:** Run the test suite in a more robust CI environment (e.g., GitHub Actions) to validate the tests themselves.
        -   **Long-term:** Investigate the performance of the testing sandbox or switch to a different CI provider if the issue persists. The tests themselves may also need optimization to remove long, fixed-wait periods (`waitForTimeout`).

### üü° P1: High-Priority Defects

1.  **JavaScript Code Lacks Type Safety**
    -   **Issue:** The linter reported over 100 errors related to missing TypeScript types (e.g., `explicit-function-return-type`, `no-unsafe-argument`). The game logic is written in plain JavaScript, which makes it error-prone and difficult to maintain.
    -   **Repro:** Run `npm run lint`.
    -   **Recommendation:**
        -   **Action:** Gradually migrate the game logic from JavaScript (`.js`) to TypeScript (`.ts`). This can be done file by file.
        -   **Example (in `games/breakout/breakout.js`):**
            ```diff
            - function settingsForLevel(l){
            + function settingsForLevel(l: number): Record<string, number> {
            ```
        -   **Benefit:** This will catch bugs at compile time, improve developer tooling (autocomplete, refactoring), and make the code self-documenting.

2.  **HTML Syntax Error in Breakout Page**
    -   **Issue:** The `prettier` tool identified an invalid closing `</body>` tag in `games/breakout/breakout.html`. Modern browsers are lenient and will render this, but it is technically invalid HTML and can cause subtle parsing issues.
    -   **Repro:** Run `npm run format`.
    -   **Recommendation:**
        -   **Action:** Remove the extraneous `</body>` tag from `games/breakout/breakout.html`.

### üü¢ P2: Low-Priority Defects

1.  **Duplicate Score Submission Script**
    -   **Issue:** The `js/` directory contains two very similar files: `score-submit.js` and `score.submit.js`. It appears `score.submit.js` is an older, unused version.
    -   **Recommendation:**
        -   **Action:** Verify that `score.submit.js` is not referenced anywhere, and if so, delete it to reduce code duplication and confusion.

2.  **Typo in Space Shooter Game Logic**
    -   **Issue:** There is a typo (`suacerNext`) in the saucer-spawning logic inside `games/space-shooter/space-shooter.html`. This appears to be a harmless typo in a commented-out or redundant check, but it points to a lack of code review.
    -   **Recommendation:**
        -   **Action:** Correct the typo and remove the redundant checks.

## 3. Playwright Test Results

-   **Status:** ‚ùå **Blocked**
-   **Summary:** A full test suite was developed and is available in the `tests/` directory. However, all attempts to run the suite failed due to environment timeouts. The results below are hypothetical, based on a successful run. Failure artifacts (screenshots, videos) could not be generated.

| Page | Mobile (360x740) | Tablet (768x1024) | Desktop (1280x800) | Game Logic & API |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Home** | `Blocked` | `Blocked` | `Blocked` | `N/A` |
| **Breakout** | `Blocked` | `Blocked` | `Blocked` | `Blocked` |
| **Space Shooter** | `Blocked` | `Blocked` | `Blocked` | `Blocked` |
| **Highway Hopper** | `Blocked` | `Blocked` | `Blocked` | `Blocked` |

## 4. Lighthouse Audit Results

-   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Pass**
-   **Summary:** All pages demonstrate excellent performance, accessibility, and best practices scores, passing all thresholds.

| Page | Performance | Accessibility | Best Practices | Report |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Home** | 100 | 97 | 96 | [Link](./lighthouse/home-report.html) |
| **Breakout** | 100 | 100 | 96 | [Link](./lighthouse/breakout-report.html) |
| **Space Shooter** | 100 | 100 | 96 | [Link](./lighthouse/space-shooter-report.html) |
| **Highway Hopper** | 100 | 94 | 100 | [Link](./lighthouse/highway-hopper-report.html) |

## 5. Code Quality & Linting Summary

-   **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Improvement**
-   **Summary:** After running `eslint --fix`, **123 problems** remain. The vast majority of these require manual intervention and are related to the lack of TypeScript in the application code.
-   **Top Offenders:**
    1.  `@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type`: 50+ instances.
    2.  `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-argument`: 10+ instances.
    3.  `playwright/no-wait-for-timeout`: 10+ instances in test files.

## 6. How to Run Locally

To reproduce these checks, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Install browser binaries:**
    ```bash
    npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
    ```
3.  **Run all QA checks:**
    ```bash
    # Note: The UI tests may time out in certain environments.
    # Run `npm run test:lighthouse` and `npm run lint` separately if needed.
    npm run qa
    ```
